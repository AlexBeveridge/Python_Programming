This is a repository for my Python programming work and projects from my Business Analytics degree at Hult International Business School.

PROJECT INFO:

Text Adventure Four Lions.ipynb

This project was an individual assignment, creating a text adventure game with the initial knowledge gained from the Python module. 
I recieved a 95/100 for this project. 
Use of UDF, IF/ELIF, TRY/EXCEPT, WHILE TRUE & USER INPUTS (and more...) 

TEAM 2 Python Data Op Assignment.ipynb

This was a group assignment, however I did the Python coding on behalf of the group. 
The assignment was to create an optimization model in Excel and Python using a case study about a Thai popcorn manufacturers decision to enter the Chinese Market.
I created a dataframe in excel and used pandas to create the dataframe in Python.
I created an LP Model based on the information given and used PuLP to create the model. 
Results were given as an optimal, with constraints built into the model. 

PROGRAMMING INFO:

Both projects were completed using the Anaconda server, using Jupyter Notebook to conduct Python Analysis. 

CREDITS:

The Team Assignment was conducted by myself, Alex Beveridge, and three other contributors; 
Maria Belen Flecha Carrascosa, Jinina Rei Garcia, Luis Mendez.

Thank you to Prof. Chase Kusterer for the Python Knowledge and Prof. Omar Romero-Hernandez for the learning on data optimization models.
